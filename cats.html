                            <li>Nadalee does enjoy a good meal of canned cat food, soft blankets to burrow in, bird watching, and a touch of catnip now and again. He may function in your home like a quiet roommate who keeps to himself. He would likely prefer a calm household and he needs nothing fancy, only understanding people who will let him go at his own pace.

                            <li>This petite feline named Ascott is excitedly anticipating a loving home. He&#39;s had a bit of bad luck, but his lucked changed when he was rescued from the streets. Since he was a stray, we don&#39;t know his history. At the shelter he enjoys being talked to, receiving gentle scritches on his thin frame, eating wet cat food, and exploring his surroundings. Ascott would do better in a calmer household. Make an appointment today to meet Ascott!

                            <li>Squiggles is a declawed cat who was found wandering the streets. She is on the shy side, so a calmer environment would be best for her. Squiggles loves being sung to, cuddling in soft blankets, and being fed treats (like all-meat baby food) off your fingers. She&#39;s a social eater and loves it when you hang out with her at meal time. Patient humans are exactly what Squiggles needs. Is that you? If you don&#39;t mind giving a feline extra pampering while she learns to trust you, then Squiggles might be the perfect feline for you. Make an appointment to meet this delicate lady.
