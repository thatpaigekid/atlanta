        <h2>Company Name &amp; About</h2>
        <p>For more than 40 years, we at Companion Finder have been finding lost and abandoned pets a new home. Since 1982, we have given countless pets to kind and caring families who will give them a home. Companion Finder started when our founder heard about how their city had a large stray pet problem. With the help from the local community, he was able to set up a small building to help give these pets a life with owners who will treat them with the best possible care. </p> 
        <p> Companion Finder is a private nonprofit charity that relies on donations from people like you. If you want to help support us, please reach out to us on our <a href="./contact.html">contact page</a>.</p>
