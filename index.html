                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>For more than 40 years, we at Companion Finder have been finding lost and abandoned pets a new home. Since 1982, we have given countless pets to kind and caring families who will give them a home. Companion Finder started when our founder heard about how their city had a large stray pet problem. With the help from the local community, he was able to set up a small building to help give these pets a life with owners who will treat them with the best possible care. </p>

            <h2>Pet Care Tips!</h2>
            <p>As a pet parent you want to do everything you can to care for your pet; this involves regular, everyday activities to ensure they stay happy and healthy. Practice these ten responsible pet care tips year after year for a lifetime of happy and healthy cats and dogs.</p>

            <p>Responsible pet ownership starts with regular visits to the veterinarian. Given their shorter-than-human lifespan, your dog or cat should be getting a checkup at least once or twice a year. Depending on your pet's vaccination schedule, they may go more frequently when they're young, but establishing and maintaining good pet health means keeping up with vet visits as they age.</p>
